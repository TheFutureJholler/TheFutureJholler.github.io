'''
(a) More than one entry per key not allowed. Which
 means no duplicate key is allowed. When duplicate keys
  encountered during assignment, the last
 assignment wins. For example −
 '''
# dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Name': 'Manni'}
# 
# print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])


''' ------------------------------------------------------------'''
''' 

(b) Keys must be immutable. Which means you can 
use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys
 but something like ['key'] is not allowed. Following is a simple example:
# '''
# dict = {['Name']: 'Zara', 'Age': 7}
# print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])
